# numerical interactive examples

This is a standalone `Leptos` + `plotly.rs` client-side application for
building interactive examples directly on top of the `numerical` crate.

The scaffold is intentionally simple:

- `Leptos` manages app state and controls.
- `plotly.rs` builds figure specs in Rust.
- Plot rendering is delegated to Plotly.js in the browser.
- Each example lives in plain Rust and can call directly into `numerical`.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the wasm target:

   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

2. Install `trunk`:

   ```bash
   cargo install trunk
   ```

## Run

```bash
cd examples/leptos-plotly
trunk serve
```

Then open the local URL reported by `trunk`.

## Layout

- `src/app.rs`: overall shell, example catalog, and page switching
- `src/catalog.rs`: major-feature catalog used by the sidebar and home screen
- `src/examples/`: concrete example pages
- `src/plot_helpers.rs`: small shared plotting helpers for multi-trace line charts
- `src/plotly_support.rs`: thin bridge from Leptos effects to Plotly.js

## Current demos

- `Linear Algebra / Sparse Solvers`: sparse LU versus BiCGSTAB on the same shifted tridiagonal system
- `Linear Algebra / Sparse Cholesky`: sparse LLT versus LDLT on symmetric positive-definite and indefinite systems
- `Linear Algebra / Equilibration`: two-sided sparse scaling and its effect on BiCGSTAB convergence
- `Linear Algebra / Dense Eigen + SVD`: eigenvalue maps and singular spectra for self-adjoint and non-normal dense matrices
- `Linear Algebra / Gramians + HSVD`: controllability/observability Gramian spectra plus HSVD versus a plain SVD of `A`
- `LTI Analysis / Process Models`: delayed FOPDT step and Bode exploration
- `LTI Analysis / Plot Gallery`: Bode, Nyquist, Nichols, pole-zero, and root-locus inspection from one loop transfer
- `Filter Design / Butterworth Lowpass`: interactive digital SOS design and Bode inspection
- `Estimation / Kalman Workbench`: recursive versus steady-state discrete Kalman filtering
- `Estimation / Nonlinear Tracking`: fixed-linearization KF versus EKF versus UKF on the same nonlinear range-tracking problem
- `Identification / OKID + ERA`: sampled I/O identification and realized-model comparison
- `Identification / Process-Model Fitting`: FOPDT and SOPDT surrogate fitting on matched and mismatched step-response data
- `Reduction / Balanced Truncation`: HSV spectrum plus full/reduced step-response comparison
- `Synthesis / PID Design`: SIMC and frequency-domain PID tuning across process models and a higher-order linear plant
- `Synthesis / Discrete LQR`: open-loop versus closed-loop sampled regulation

## Adding a new example

1. Add a new `ExampleId` + catalog entry in `src/catalog.rs`.
2. Add a page component under `src/examples/`.
3. Register the page in `src/examples/mod.rs`.
4. Add a `match` arm in `src/app.rs`.

The existing pages are the reference patterns for:

- control-panel signals
- derived plot generation
- calling `numerical` directly from UI logic
- rendering Plotly figures from Rust
