//! Fixed-size runtime LTI kernels.
//!
//! This module intentionally contains execution-oriented kernels rather than
//! design-facing alternate representations. In particular:
//!
//! - fixed FIR and fractional-delay filters are provided directly
//! - fixed state-space and PID runtimes are provided directly
//! - fixed delta-SOS is provided as the embedded IIR execution form
//!
//! There is intentionally no fixed ordinary SOS storage type here yet. The
//! expected workflow is to design or store IIR filters in the alloc-side
//! control layer, then convert to delta-SOS before deploying into the fixed
//! embedded runtime.
