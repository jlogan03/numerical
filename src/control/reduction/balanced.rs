//! Balanced realization and balanced truncation for state-space models.
//!
//! This module relies on the Gramian solver set needed for balanced
//! realization and truncation:
//!
//! - dense continuous Lyapunov
//! - sparse continuous low-rank Lyapunov
//! - dense discrete Stein
//! - sparse discrete low-rank Stein
//!
//! This module sits above those solvers and performs the balancing step:
//!
//! 1. obtain controllability and observability Gramian data
//! 2. delegate the balancing-core work to [`super::hsvd`]
//! 3. assemble the reduced state-space system from the returned projections
//!
//! Standard balanced realization and truncation assume the plant is
//! asymptotically stable in the relevant time domain:
//!
//! - continuous time: all poles lie in the open left half-plane
//! - discrete time: all poles lie strictly inside the unit disk
//!
//! The implementation follows that standard setting. In practice this
//! means the underlying Gramian solves are only meaningful for stable systems,
//! so callers should check or enforce stability before using this module on an
//! open-loop plant.
//!
//! The returned result always includes the actual projection operators used to
//! build the reduced model, and can optionally retain more of the internal
//! balancing algebra on request.
//!
//! Literature:
//!
//! - Brunton and Kutz, *Data-Driven Science and Engineering*, 2nd ed.,
//!   Cambridge University Press, 2022, for a pedagogical treatment of
//!   balanced coordinates, balanced truncation, and model reduction.
//!
//! # Two Intuitions
//!
//! 1. **Input-output view.** Balanced truncation removes states that are both
//!    hard to reach from the inputs and hard to see at the outputs.
//! 2. **Full-rank view.** Balanced realization changes coordinates without
//!    changing input-output behavior, but it orders and scales the states so
//!    controllability and observability energy are directly comparable.
//! 3. **Projection view.** It is also just a carefully chosen pair of left and
//!    right projection matrices built from the HSVD core.
//!
//! # Glossary
//!
//! - **Balanced coordinates:** Coordinates where controllability and
//!   observability energies are aligned and diagonalized together.
//! - **Balanced realization:** Full numerical-rank coordinate change into
//!   balanced coordinates without an intentional order reduction.
//! - **Controllability energy:** Input effort associated with reaching a state
//!   direction, encoded by the controllability Gramian.
//! - **Observability energy:** Output response strength associated with a state
//!   direction, encoded by the observability Gramian.
//! - **Tail bound:** Classical balanced-truncation error bound based on
//!   discarded Hankel singular values.
//!
//! # Mathematical Formulation
//!
//! The module solves the appropriate Gramians, computes HSVD, and forms a
//! reduced model:
//!
//! - `A_r = W^H A V`
//! - `B_r = W^H B`
//! - `C_r = C V`
//! - `D_r = D`
//!
//! with `V` and `W` built from the retained balanced directions.
//!
//! # Implementation Notes
//!
//! - The module is a workflow layer on top of Gramian solvers plus `hsvd`.
//! - Dense and low-rank workflows share the same outward result contract.
//! - Stability is a precondition, not an internal stabilization step.
